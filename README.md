# Description

The idea of this project is to be able to easily draw genetic circuit diagrams in Ti*k*Z. Something like `\circuit{PCT}` will draw a promoter, a coding sequence, and a terminator.

Compared to dnaplotlib, this library will focus on freeform drawing of arbitrary shapes and circuits.

For now, all that is in this repository is a PGF/Ti*k*Z library that adds a custom bent arrow node shape to use as a promoter.
